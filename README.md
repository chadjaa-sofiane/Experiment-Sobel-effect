## Description

**SobelInteractive** is a web-based application that demonstrates the Sobel operator for edge detection using the HTML5 canvas element. The main feature of this project is:

- **Sobel Edge Detection**: The application applies the Sobel operator, a gradient-based edge detection algorithm, to an input image. The result is a grayscale image where the edges and contours are highlighted and emphasized.
  The Sobel effect is achieved by rendering the original image on an HTML5 canvas and then processing the pixel data using JavaScript. The processed image data is then displayed back on the canvas, allowing users to interactively explore the edge detection effect.

This project showcases the power of web technologies like HTML5 canvas and JavaScript for image processing and visualization. It provides an engaging and educational experience for users to understand the concept of edge detection and the Sobel operator.

Key features of the application include:

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload their own images to the application.
- **Interactive Reveal**: Users can move their mouse cursor over the processed image to reveal the original image underneath, creating an interactive and dynamic effect.
- **Radius Adjustment**: The radius of the circular reveal area can be adjusted using intuitive input controls (increment/decrement buttons or a number input field).
